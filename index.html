Unraveling Connections: Homicides vs. Mental Health Support in Toronto
    <br>
    <br>

    <b> 1.0 Introduction: </b>
<br>
This infographic explores the connection between the number of homicides and the accessibility of mental health facilities in Toronto's neighborhoods. The locations of the two topics I chose were funneled from two separate datasets into a singular infographic to determine if these factors correlate and to provide recommendations to improve public health and urban planning policy.
    
    <br>
    <br>

<b>2.0 Visualization Techniques:</b>
  <br> 
    I implemented several data visualization and analytical techniques to investigate this connection. These variables' spatial distribution and density were emphasized using geospatial mapping and heatmaps within my infographic. The plotted graph displayed a pattern where larger concentrations usually occur in downtown regions with high population density. Data wrangling in Excel by using pivot tables, summarising graphs, and organizing important columns of data, provided further neighborhood-specific details for the count comparison. There seems to be a relationship between the number of mental health facilities and the number of homicides in the area (although it may depend on several other variables not provided, i.e., population density). I found that targetted regions for urban and public health planning were found to be communities with high homicidal rates and few mental health facilities—neighborhoods that would benefit from more resources.
<br>
    <br>
<b> 3.0 Design Decisions:</b>
    <br>
I used a gradient palette—with darker pink and red hues meaning larger concentrations—to create a clear visual hierarchy that draws attention to important areas. The arrangement of information, choice of visual components, and color coding also guarantee that the connection displayed is readable and easily understood. I also included annotations strategically to assist in guiding the viewer’s eyes (limiting words in the process) through the visual data and emphasize findings, such as locations with significant concentrations of both murders and mental health institutes. This decision guarantees that the visual representations stay simple despite the complexity of the underlying data; it’ll simplify how stakeholders comprehend and draw inferences from the findings. This information can help with decisions concerning the location of future mental health institutions in urban planning through data-based justification. Furthermore, the results validate data-driven approaches in community safety initiatives, focusing intervention efforts to enhance the general well-being of the community.
    <br>
    <br>

<b> 4.0 Conclusion:</b>
    <br>
This project highlights the potential of data-driven decisions in improving community safety by demonstrating a systematic approach to examining data. By emphasizing the connections between mental health services and murders, policymaking can ensure the greater safety of the public.
